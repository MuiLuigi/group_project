            <h2>Geoffrey Crosse | Student Chef </h2>
            <p>
                I’m a passionate individual with a love for cricket, photography, music, and movies, 
                which fuel my creativity and bring balance to my life. As someone who enjoys both the 
                strategic aspects of cricket and the art of storytelling in film, I appreciate the blend 
                of logic and creativity. Alongside my hobbies, I have a deep interest in data analytics, 
                constantly exploring ways to leverage data to uncover insights and solve real-world problems. 
                Whether analyzing stats, diving into a good movie, or catching a cricket match, I enjoy 
                engaging with the world in diverse ways. I'm always looking for new ways to learn, grow, 
                and apply my skills across different fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most rewarding ways I express my creativity is through cooking. I love 
                experimenting with flavors, exploring dishes from around the world, and turning everyday 
                ingredients into something special. Whether it’s crafting the perfect pasta sauce or plating 
                a colorful salad, I see each recipe as a canvas — where food and art meet. Cooking isn’t 
                just a passion; it’s a poetic experience that I enjoy sharing with others through 
                Plated Poetry.
